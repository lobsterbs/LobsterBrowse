# Multi-stage build for the LobsterBrowse single-site service:
# the Rust Wisp server and the static M3E UI it serves from one origin.
# Builder tracks latest stable Rust: zeroize 1.9+ manifests need cargo >= 1.85.
# Reproducibility: same LobsterBrowse commit + same Dockerfile + pinned
# ZEOLITE_COMMIT below must give identical build inputs. Bump the pin
# by updating both the ARG and the zeolite-server rev in
# server/bin/server/Cargo.toml (and the committed server/Cargo.lock via
# the generate-rust-lockfile workflow), then clear the Render build cache.

# Zeolite engine bundle: an immutable Zeolite commit carries the green
# build of the engine service worker and its chunks (libcurl stripped
# there: the AGPL bundle is never committed to git). Vendored here at
# build time so the server can serve it same-origin at /zlsw/ and the
# UI can register the worker. Pinned to an exact revision instead of a
# moving branch so rebuilds are deterministic.
# Current pin: dist b2ad04e8 (Zeolite main d7263bb, CI run 37671927204)
# 2026-10-07 (5). The engine week since 13ae7da8: wisp auth verified
# against client payloads, loopback bind + Origin guard + fail-closed
# auth config + security headers, JSON configs swapped for KDL, SW
# keepalive for streaming documents (#99), SipHash length-word mask
# for long-destination routes (#100), child-realm reemit + escape log
# (#101), 204/205 navigation error page (#102), iframe/embed/object
# destination classification (#103), popup activation guard (#106),
# 30s navigate first-byte deadline + post-redirect rewrite base
# (#107), child-realm storage/cookie isolation (#108), SWR refresh
# coalescing. sw.js is now f90129af, bootstrap.js 84c8ec97. Cargo-side
# pin moves 602b660 -> 483aa0f (KDL server config, wisp auth
# verification, security headers).
