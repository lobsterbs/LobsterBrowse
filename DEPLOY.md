# Deploying LobsterBrowse

## Server (Render web service, Docker)

- Runtime: Docker, Dockerfile at repo root (builds the Rust workspace).
- Env vars:
  - `PORT` (set by Render automatically; the server reads it).
  - `WISP_PATH` — Wisp endpoint path, defaults to `/wisp/`. Randomize per deployment.
  - `WISP_PASSWORD` / `WISP_USERNAME` — optional password auth (extension 0x02).
  - `DATABASE_URL` — Neon Postgres connection string (used by the upcoming sessions crate).
- Health check: `GET /healthz`.

## Zeolite engine pin

The engine bundle served at `/zlsw/` comes from the `dist` branch of
lobsterbs/Zeolite at the `ZEOLITE_COMMIT` pinned in the Dockerfile; the
Rust wisp handler comes from the zeolite-server git rev pinned in
`server/bin/server/Cargo.toml`. The two must move together: bump both,
let the generate-rust-lockfile workflow commit the new `server/Cargo.lock`,
then let the push-triggered Render autoDeploy run (see the reliability
checklist below). Note that the
lockfile workflow's own commit does not run CI; the next push or a
manual re-run is what proves the pair green. A pin commit is also
red in CI by construction: the rust job's cargo --locked fails
while server/Cargo.lock still holds the old revs. That red run is
expected, not a regression. The verdict that matters is the green
Generate server lockfile run on the same SHA, which runs the same
fmt/build/test/clippy gates as the CI rust job before it lands
the lock.

## UI (Render static site)

- Build: `cd ui && npm ci && npm run build`
- Publish: `ui/dist`

## Database (Neon)

A Neon Postgres project is provisioned; its connection string is injected into the
server as `DATABASE_URL`. Free tier, autosuspended when idle.

Current pin: Zeolite dist 9927bd7 (pin 91: the app security wave -
#337 document.cookie cannot overwrite or delete an HttpOnly
cookie, #338 x-zl-cached-at / x-zl-final-url are stripped from
served cache views, #341 an If-Range validator mismatch serves
the full body instead of a range slice, #344 WEBNAV
.domContentLoaded fires from the sender-derived dest, #349
cookie names and values reject control characters, #336 the
compat doc discloses the zl:ext one-world limit (Zeolite
60b9404a, CI run 39142882453 all 5 jobs green, suite 1309
incl. 9 new tests)), zlswSha e20a18398c4d25a8 ->
54e173c073e5de4b and bootstrapSha unchanged 8c7520cbfad8035d;
the wasm is untouched too (7908d03c7920f8a7). This matches the
Dockerfile ZEOLITE_COMMIT; the zeolite-server git rev stays
b0296f8 because the wave does not touch zeolite-server, and
server/Cargo.lock is consistent with the pin.

## Build/deploy reliability checklist (0.3 Titanium)

- A pin move is ONE commit: the Dockerfile ARG, the zeolite-server
  rev in server/bin/server/Cargo.toml, the regenerated
  server/Cargo.lock, this file's pin note and AGENTS.md's pin line
  move together. Never land half a pin.
- Deploys are API-triggered: autoDeploy is off on both services.
  Trigger with clearCache: true after every pin bump, then verify
  /build: buildShort must equal the pushed SHA and zlswSha must equal
  the Dockerfile ENV pin. A 2026-09-30 deploy once built from a
  stale git ref (deploy metadata named the new commit, the image
  served the old one; /build proved it); the /build check after
  every deploy is the guard.
- After every deploy, verify /build: buildShort must equal the pushed
  SHA, and zlswSha must change when the Zeolite pin moved. /healthz
  must answer ok. A "live" deploy status alone proves nothing.
- Always cache-bust /build and /healthz queries (?cb=<now>) when
  fetching through external readers; they serve stale JSON otherwise.
- The generate-rust-lockfile workflow's own commit does not run CI;
  the next push (or a retrigger commit) proves the lock/pin pair
  green before the deploy is trusted.
